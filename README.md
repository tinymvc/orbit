# Installation
It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install this orbit admin panel Kit.

```bash
$ composer require tinymvc/orbit
```

Then Register the Orbit Service Provider:
```php
<?php
# bootstrap/providers.php

return [
    // Application service provider for registering and bootstrapping services
    \Orbit\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
];

```
